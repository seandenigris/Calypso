## Installation
```Smalltalk
Metacello new
  baseline: 'Calypso';
  repository: 'github://pharo-ide/Calypso';
  load
```
To make Calypso default toolset evaluate:
```Smalltalk
ClyBrowser beAllDefault
```
And to open browser evaluate: 
```Smalltalk
ClyFullBrowser open.
```
### Pharo 6 installation on Windows
To install Calypso properly on Windows check that Iceberg intergation is disabled (it is disabled by default):
```Smalltalk
Iceberg enableMetacelloIntegration: false
```
There are long package and methods names in Calypso (related to tests) which are the problem of FileTree format on Windows.

## Problems
If you will find many processes hanging in the image it can be caused by some issue of critic plugin implementation. Some people report it in the past. It should be fixed now but there is always possibility that fix is not complete.

Following line should be enough to disable critic method group with all related computation. It is the main reason of that kind of problems:
```Smalltalk
ClyCriticEnvironmentPlugin disableMethodGroup.
```
It is not full critic disable. If it not helps then turn off it completely:
```Smalltalk
ClyCriticBrowserPlugin disable.
ClyCriticEnvironmentPlugin disable.
ClyNavigationEnvironment reset.
```
And please report this problem on issue tracker or with direct mail to me or Pharo mailing list.
## FAQ

### What is a "Project" (as opposed to a "Package")?
While project mode will become the default view in the future, for now it is more like a stub. 
Some of the current directions are integration with a new package management [Cargo](https://github.com/demarey/cargo) (Christophe is working on it) and a possible Metacello backend.
